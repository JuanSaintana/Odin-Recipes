      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        lasagna is an Italian dish made of stacked layers of thin flat pasta
        alternating with fillings such as ragù, vegetables, and cheese, and
        seasonings such as garlic, oregano, and basil. It is made with a flat
        noodle, such as lasagna, or with sheets of pasta cut into squares or
        rectangles. The dish is popular in many countries, and is commonly made
        with a meat-based ragù, but can also be made with vegetables, seafood,
        or cheese. It is often topped with melted cheese, such as mozzarella,
        parmesan, or a mixture of the two.

          Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions until they
          are al dente (firm to the bite), then drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large skillet, heat some olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the
          chopped onions and minced garlic and cook until they are soft and
          fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the ground beef and or italian sausage to the skillet and cook
          util browned, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon or
          spatula.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the tomato sauce and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to
          medium-low and pinch of salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese,
          and pinch of salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          To assemble the lasagna, spread a layer of the meat sauce in the
          bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Add a layer of lasagna noodles on
          top, then spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the
          noodles. Sprinkle some shredded mozzarella cheese on top. Repeat this
          layering process until you have used up all your of ingredients,
          ending with a layer of the meat sauce and a generous sprinkling of
          shredded mozzarella cheese on top.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 25-30 minutes. Remove the
          foil and bake for 25-30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an
          additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and
          the lasagna is heated through.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Top
          with some chopped fresh basil and red pepper flakes, if desired.
