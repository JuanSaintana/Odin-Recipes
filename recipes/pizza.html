      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin, consisting of a usually round,
        flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes,
        cheese, and often various other ingredients (anchovies, olives, meat,
        etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a
        wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person
        who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo. The term pizza was first
        recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern
        Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania. Modern
        pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since
        become popular in many countries. The term "pizza" was first documented
        in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio,
        on the border with Campania, dated 997 AD. The Neapolitan pizza was born
        in the 18th or 19th century in the taverns of Naples. The word pizza was
        first recorded in the Gaeta document, dated 997 AD. The modern pizza was
        invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become
        popular in many countries and pizza restaurants have been established in
        most metropolitan areas around the world. The first pizzeria was opened
        in 1830, in Naples.
