      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cook the spaghetti noodles according to package instructions until
          they are al dente(firm to the bite), then drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the noodles are cooking, heat some olive oil in a large skillet
          over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add some minced garlic to the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes, or
          until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          If using ground beef and or italian sausage, add it to the skillet and
          cook until it's browned and cooked through. If using onions, bell
          peppers, and or mushrooms, add them to the skillet and cook until they
          are softened and lightly browned.
        </li>
        <li>
          If using anchovies, add them to the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes
          until they have dissolved into the oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          If using white or red wine, deglaze the skillet with a splash of wine
          and cook for a minute or two until most of the liquid has evaporated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the tomato sauce to the skillet and stir to combine. Season with
          salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add any additional ingredients you like, such as capers, olives, or
          diced tomatoes. Simmer the sauce for 10-15 minutes, stirring
          occasionally, until the flavors have melded together and the sauce has
          thickened slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the cooked spaghetti noodles to the skillet and toss with the
          sauce until the noodles are coated evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve the spaghetti with grated parmesan cheese and fresh basil, if
          desired.
